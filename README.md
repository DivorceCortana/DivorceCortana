# DivorceCortana

Ingore the verbiage. I'm still proofing the readme.

Warning: Divorce Cortana is distructive. System Restore is your best friend and most likely you'll need to revert back.


Who should use Divorce Cortana?
You have to be a tech savey person. You need to have knowledge how to use System Restore to get your system back to previous state.

What are the current side effects?

The search in start menu gets disabled: You can pin your common apps to the start menu or find a start menu replacement software.
My Window 10 pro start menu gets disabled the first time I open it, then the second click on start it works
My Window 10 Ent start menu is disable after a restart. I run a powershell command to fix it, must run every restart

Is it safe?
No, You are guaranteed to make your system crash. Make sure you create a system restore before running Divorice Cortana.


Are there any testing so it doen't crash my computer?
Yes and no. I have 1 Windows 10 Pro mostly used for youtube, Windows 10 Enterprise used for development and general use, and 1 Windows 7 pro. I try to make 1 change and wait for a week to make sure it doesn't completely break Windows.


Are there any testing before disabling a new service?
I generally will disable a new service and test it for a week before. 



Edit Host file, better yet if you can run your own dns server add the domains to your dns server
and that will also disable any subdomains.


Additional Steps you can take for privacy:
Install CCleaner and create a scheduled task with /AUTO
 -- Disable additional plugins in Firefox used for telemtry
